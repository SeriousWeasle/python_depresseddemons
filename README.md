# python_depresseddemons
Fake NFT generator for a fake lineup named "Depressed Demons".

# Usage
Feel free to fork it and make whatever from it. The code can be used however you like, I wrote it in about 30 minutes and it is bad anyway.
Please do credit me if you use any of the sprites in your projects. A link to my GitHub (https://github.com/SeriousWeasle) or to here (https://github.com/SeriousWeasle/python_depresseddemons) is fine.

***I do not allow any of the sprites to be used in any paid product. This is meant as a parody to NFT's and therefore, these sprites and images made with the program should remain completely free.***

# Why does this exist?
I got bored and decided to make this atrocity.
